Nested Lists

Problem Statement:

  Given the names and grades for each student in a Physics class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any
  student(s) having the second lowest grade.
  Note: If there are multiple students with the same grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

  Input Format
     The first line contains an integer, N, the number of students. 
     The 2N subsequent lines describe each student over 2 lines; the first line contains a student's name, and the second line contains
     their grade.

  Constraints
     2 <= N <= 5
     There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade.

  Output Format
     Print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade in Physics; if there are multiple students, order their names
     alphabetically and print each one on a new line.
     
Python Code:
  
import sys
if __name__ == '__main__':
    l=[]
    newl=[]
    for i in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        l.append([name,score])
    n=len(l)
    fmax=l[0][1]
    smax=l[n-1][1]
    for i in range(n):
        if (l[i][1] <= fmax):
            fmax = l[i][1]
        for j in range(n):
            if ((l[j][1] > fmax) & (l[j][1] <= smax)):
                    smax= l[j][1]
    for i in range(n):
        if(l[i][1]==smax):
            newl.append(l[i][0])
            newl.sort()
    m=len(newl)
    for i in range(m):
        print(newl[i])
